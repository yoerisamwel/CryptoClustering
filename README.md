# CryptoClustering

This project is part of the George Washington University Data analysis bootcamp. It is part of a introduction to unsupervised machine learning using Sklearn and python. A very interesting topic and I enjoyed working on this project and the part of the course in general.

The first part of the Jupiter notebook file is reading in and analyzing the data. The dataset provided was mostly  ready to be used and did not have to be prepared further.

Second was adjusting the data frame to make it ready for use in the analysis.

Third we ran the Elbow curve analysis to determine the best value of k which was 4 for this dataset. With 4 we ran the initial prediction.
After this we ran the PCA analysis on the dataset. Which suggested the best value for k was 3. 

I compared the different graphs at the end visually and came to the conclusion that there was no significant difference between the 3 and 4 k values.
Overall a very interesting project and I am looking forward to integrating this into projects at work.

The original scatterplot based on k being 4:

The PCA clusters with the value of k being 3. With the three clusters I choose to use a 3d visualization to make the analysis visually easier.
